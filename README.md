# Hunt-The-Lennie
Hunt The Lennie. Final project for Computer Science 1 at The University of Cincinnati.

This project of mine was based on the popular online game [Hunt The Wumpus.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunt_the_Wumpus) This game was developed as the final project for my Computer Science 1 class at The University of Cincinnati. As a little challenge to myself, I decided to see how long it would take me to create this project from start to finish, in one sitting. The v1.0 version, which was the version I submitted for class, ended up taking me just under 6 hours in total to create. From that initial version I expanded upon it and added new features to make it more user-friendly.

This project may have been created out of necessity however, it ended up being something that I was proud of due to the overall cleanness of the code and the polish final project. I am also very proud of the short development time that it had, with the entire development of it just taking a few hours.
